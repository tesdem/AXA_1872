# AXA_1872
Repository for Predicting Mental Health
# This is ReadME file for running the 'Predicting mental Health' Predective model
All of the codes for this project run in Jupyter notebooks.

 - Make sure you to locate the folder where the necessary source and datasets are
 - Make sure test dataset (X_test) is ready for running the model - with identical structure to the training dataset

You can run the model as follows:

1. Change your folder to the folder when the project is stored
2. Start Jupyter Notebook from command prompt
3. Go to 'test'folder and open the 'AXA 1872 - Trained Model.ipynb' python notebook
4. Select 'Run' menu and then 'Run All cells' command from the menu options
 
Once the running is complete, you will have new csv dataset (prediction_test.csv) with a predicted response variable values.
